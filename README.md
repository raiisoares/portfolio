# Personal Portfolio

This project is a personal portfolio website developed using Next.js to showcase my work and skills as a software 
engineer. The site is designed with a clean, responsive interface to highlight projects, technical expertise, 
and professional experiences effectively. By incorporating modern tools such as Tailwind CSS for styling, Framer Motion 
for animations, and Vercel for deployment, the portfolio provides an engaging and interactive user experience.

This README will guide you through the key technologies used, setup instructions, and insights into the design choices 
made to create a seamless presentation of my work.

1. **Create a `.env.local` file**:
    - Add a `RESEND_API_KEY=` with your Resend API key.

2. **Run the application**:
    - To run the application in the development environment, use the following command:
      `pnpm dev`

After completing these steps, the application should be fully operational

## Tools and Services for Development

### User Interface

The user interface was built using the **Shadcn/UI** component library and **Tailwind CSS** as the primary styling framework. To enhance the user experience, **Framer Motion** is used for animations and **Sonner** for notifications, ensuring a dynamic and interactive design.

- **Shadcn/UI**: A component library for building user interfaces with a clean, accessible, and customizable design system, built specifically for React.
   - [Documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs)

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs without having to leave your HTML, providing flexibility and rapid development.
   - [Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)

- **Framer Motion**: A library for animations in React, offering smooth transitions and complex animation sequences.
